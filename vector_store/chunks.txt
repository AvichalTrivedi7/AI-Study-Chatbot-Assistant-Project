Unit 1: Artificial Intelligence Overview 1. Foundation of AI Models AI models are systems designed to replicate human intelligence. Their foundation relies on three pillars: ● Data : AI requires structured (e.g., tables) and unstructured (e.g., text, images) data to function. ● Algorithms : Tools used to process the data and learn patterns (e.g., decision trees, neural networks). ● Learning Paradigms : ○ Supervised Learning : Trains on labeled data (e.g., predicting housing prices).

○ Unsupervised Learning : Identifies hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering customer groups). ○ Reinforcement Learning : Improves through trial-and-error (e.g., game-playing bots). Expanded Foundations : ● Philosophy : Introduced concepts of mind as a machine, influencing early AI. ● Mathematics : Contributed formalizations in computation, logic, and probability. ● Psychology : Provided reasoning models by studying human cognition.

● Computer Engineering : Created hardware enabling large-scale computation. ● Control Theory : Focused on feedback systems for adaptive behavior. ● Linguistics : Developed methods for understanding and generating natural language. Potential Questions: ● Define the foundation of AI models. ● What are the different learning paradigms in AI? ● Explain the role of data in AI. ● How have other disciplines influenced the foundation of AI? 2.

I'll organize detailed notes for you. If you need additional focus on specific areas, let me know. 1. Problem State Space Search ● State Space Definition : ○ A state contains all the information needed to predict action effects and recognize goal states. ○ Agents have perfect knowledge of the state space, actions, and deterministic effects. ● Components of a State-Space Problem : ○ Set of states, including start and goal states. ○ Actions available for each state.

○ An action function to determine resulting states. ○ Goal criterion and quality measure of solutions. ● Search Space Representation : ○ Typically modeled as graphs with nodes (states) and arcs (actions). ○ Types: Directed/undirected, connected, weighted, or tree structures. ○ Examples: Towers of Hanoi, Water Jug Problem, 8-Puzzle Problem. 2. Production Systems ● Components : ○ Production Rules : IF-THEN structure. ○ Database : Stores task-specific information.

○ Control Strategy : Manages rule application order and conflict resolution. ○ Rule Applier : Matches state with rules to determine applicability. ● Features : ○ Simplicity, Modularity, Modifiability, Knowledge-intensive. ● Disadvantages : ○ Opacity, inefficiency, absence of learning, and conflict resolution issues. 3. Types of Search Algorithms Uninformed Search Algorithms (Blind Search): ● Depth-First Search (DFS) : ○ Explores as deep as possible before backtracking.

○ Incomplete (prone to infinite loops) and non-optimal. ○ Space complexity: O(bm), where b is branching factor, m is depth. ● Breadth-First Search (BFS) : ○ Explores all nodes level by level. ○ Complete and optimal (for equal edge costs). ○ Space complexity: O(b^m). ● Uniform Cost Search (UCS) : ○ Accounts for varying action costs. ○ Complete and optimal but explores all directions.

Informed Search Algorithms (Heuristic-based): ● Greedy Search : ○ Uses heuristic function h(n) to estimate closeness to the goal. ○ Fast but not always optimal. ● A Search *: ○ Combines cost-to-node g(n) and heuristic h(n) (f(n) = g(n) + h(n)). ○ Optimal and complete under admissible heuristics. 4. Heuristic Search ● Definition : ○ Methods to find good solutions efficiently, often sacrificing completeness.

● Types : ○ Generate-and-Test Algorithm : ■ Generates solutions and tests against the goal state. ○ Hill Climbing : ■ Evaluates neighbor states to choose the best local move. ■ Issues: Stuck in local maxima, plateaus, or ridges. ○ Simulated Annealing : ■ Adds random moves to escape local optima, balancing efficiency and completeness. 5. Special Algorithms ● Bidirectional Search : ○ Searches forward from start and backward from goal. ○ Time complexity: O(b^(d/2)).

● AO Algorithm *: ○ Solves AND-OR graph problems. ○ Suitable for problems decomposable into sub-problems. 6. Problem Characteristics and Classification ● Is the problem decomposable? ● Can steps be undone or ignored? ● Is the solution absolute or relative? ● Role of knowledge in solving the problem.
